	The cObject ViewHelper outputs TypoScript content Objects.
	The output is already raw and don't need a additional format ViewHelper.
	See http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptReference/ContentObjects/Index.html
	Objects that are stored inside "temp." don't work because they are unset after template parsing.
